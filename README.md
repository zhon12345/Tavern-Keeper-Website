## ‚ùó Important (please read)

Ppeople have asked me if they can use this code for their own website, and the answer is usually **yes, with proper credit linking back to https://tavernkeeper.ml**.

I value keeping my most of my projects open source, but as most you know, ***plagiarism is bad***. It's always breaks my heart whenever I encounter someone who has copied my code without giving me **any** credit, this is the sole reason why I deleted all the code in [Tavern Keeper](https://github.com/zhon12345/tavern_keeper/). I spent a good amount of time and effort building and designing my website. All I ask of you is to not claim my effort as your own. Thanks for reading.
